This repository is for analyzing and maybe enhancing colormaps used at NSIDC.


# Usage

Run a python script, e.g. `python concentration.py` to view an analysis of a
colormap.


## TODO

Need a way to save and edit the colormaps. `python -m viscm edit foo.jscm` would
work if we could find out how to generate the JSCM file.


# Resources

The following page is a postmortem of the colormap analysis that went in to
selecting the new default colormap (viridis) for matplotlib.
